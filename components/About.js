                    Outside of coding, I love getting my hands dirty with creative projects like home renovations and various DIY endeavors. There's something special about the process of bringing ideas to life through tangible, hands-on work. Combining my technical expertise with a love for hands-on creativity defines my approach to both professional and personal pursuits. It's a journey where innovation meets craftsmanship, and I'm excited to see where it leads next.
